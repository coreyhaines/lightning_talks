Go through discussion about where to start!

Talks index

Go to URL
- build route
- build controller
- build action
- build view

Show talks
- add iteration to view
- add empty array as list of @talks to controller
- add seed file with some talks
- change empty array to Talk.all

Decision point: What next?
- Submit a talk
- Vote on a talk

Which adds value?
Submit a talk - is there an alternate way to do it?
Vote on a talk - direct feature making application more useful

Which feature would allow us to get closer to using the application?
Vote on a talk

Start with display of vote count
- add to view
- create a migration to add it
rails g migration add_vote_count_to_talk vote_count:integer
make default = 0
- add to seed file
vote_count: rand(10)

- Catch mass-assignment issue
- Also need to flush talks at top of seed file
